# LU-Decomposition
LU Decomposition in Python

These are a couple LU Decomposition programs I had coded in python for school. 
The sequential algorithm is used as a performance comparison to the parallelized LU Decomposition version. 

Both programs allow for an unlimited sized square matrix, which can be altered from within the code itself.
